# Power (energy) mechanics in SWGB

## Intro

Power is a unique feature of SWGB. It is necessary to produce units
efficiently, and for shield generators. It thus makes power generators a
strategic target.

Powered buildings have green lights on them, instead of flashing red lights. A
green indicator also lights up [in the UI](user-interface.md#cap) when a
powered unit is selected.

## Mechanism

Power **only** affects unit creation and research times.

It doesn't affect things like food production for animal nurseries, or other
resource collection.

Unpowered buildings work at 25% speed, including research and unit production.
Shield generator buildings need to be powered to provide a shield.

The clone campaigns extension contains [mobile power
generators](https://swgb.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Droid), units that can be built
at a power generator.

## Always-powered buildings

Command centers and Fortresses are always powered. So are power generators.
