          <h3>Does signing a bid cost any gas or ETH?</h3>
          <div className="dash" />
          <p>
            No, the auction is off-chain. Signing does not cost any gas, ETH, or
            MANA.

            I am outbid on a parcel, can I spend that amount on another bid?

          <div className="dash" />
          <p>
            Yes. As soon as you are outbid, the bid amount will be available for
            other bids.

            Enable email notifications by entering your email in the
            notifications address window in the sidebar and signing your wallet
            address to your email.

          <h3>I canâ€™t zoom out!</h3>
          <div className="dash" />
          <p>
            Because all parcels contain unique information, the zoom is
            restricted to prevent request timeouts when loading large batches of
            land. This is a carefully-considered tradeoff.

          <p>
            Click and drag on the map to move around, or click on the minimap to
            move across the city. You can also search for districts and
            coordinates in the search bar.

          <h3>A row or column is showing up twice!</h3>

          <p>This is a known bug which we are actively working on.</p>

        <div className="question">
          <h3>When will the auction end?</h3>
          <div className="dash" />
          <p>
            The auction will run for at least seven days, until 10PM GMT on
            Friday, December 22. The auction will end when all parcels have been
            auctioned. When a parcel receives a new bid, the deadline for that
            parcel gets extended by 30 hours. &nbsp; Given that the minimum
            increase for bids is 25%, we expect that the auction won&#39;t last
            for more than a few more days.

        <div className="question">
          <h3>When will MANA be released after the end of the auction?</h3>
          <div className="dash" />
          <p>
            Any unused MANA will be returned to wallets after the last parcel
            has closed.

          <h3>Plazas? Roads?</h3>
          <div className="dash" />
          <p>
            Decentraland has placed infrastructure around the world to provide
            for better development and exploration experiences. Plazas will be
            accessible to all members of the community for various functions.

          <p>MANA spent on land is burned when the auction ends.</p>
